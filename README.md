# Indic OCR Research Tracker

A comprehensive web-based repository tracking the state of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for Indic languages. This project aims to catalog research efforts, datasets, tools, and resources to facilitate advancements in this domain.

## Overview

Indic languages present unique challenges for OCR systems due to their complex scripts, diverse writing systems, and rich typographical traditions. This project bridges the gap between research and implementation by providing a comprehensive database of Indic OCR resources.

### Features

- **Language Tracking**: Information about OCR accuracy and challenges for various Indic languages
- **Research Papers**: Database of academic papers related to Indic OCR research
- **Datasets**: Collection of datasets available for Indic OCR development and testing
- **Tools**: List of software tools and libraries for Indic OCR processing
- **Resources**: Organizations, initiatives, and additional resources for Indic OCR
